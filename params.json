{"name":"ff","tagline":"Easily search and process files.","body":"ff\r\n==\r\n\r\nEasily search and process files.\r\n\r\nIt's not designed for search by file content. If you need this, see [ack](https://github.com/petdance/ack2) or [pss](https://github.com/eliben/pss).\r\n\r\nBasic usage\r\n-----------\r\n\r\n    ff passwd\r\n\r\nSearch for all files and directories in current directory and below, which is match to pattern: `*passwd*`.\r\n\r\n    ff -B passwd\r\n\r\nSearch for all files and directories in current directory and below, which is match to pattern: `*passwd`.\r\n\r\n    ff -E passwd\r\n\r\nSearch for all files and directories in current directory and below, which is match to pattern: `passwd*`.\r\n\r\n    ff -EB passwd\r\n\r\nAdvanced usage\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n    ./ff.py -p pa -s /etc --shell-exec -x '[ -f \"{path}\" ] && mkdir -p /tmp{dirname}; cp -r \"{path}\" \"/tmp{path}\"'\r\n\r\nFind all files and directories in /etc that match expression: `*pa*`, and copy them (with original directories hierarchy!) to /tmp.\r\n\r\nSo powerful!\r\n\r\nMagic pattern\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nIt's form of pattern known good for Perl or AWK lovers :)\r\n\r\nIf patterns is in general form:\r\n\r\n    mode/pattern/modifier\r\n\r\n(decribed more in full usage below), then it is parsed and used in a little other manner.\r\n\r\nInstead of arguments `--regexp` or `--fuzzy`, you can pass it in `mode` part of pattern.\r\nNext there is delimiter, which usually is `/` (backslash), but there can be more characters,\r\ndescribed in Usage section.\r\n\r\nAfter that is a pattern, next delimiter again, and then modifiers (again, modifiers are described in Usage section).\r\n\r\nSome examples:\r\n\r\nSearch for all files and directories in current directory and below, which is match to pattern: `passwd`.\r\n\r\n    ff f/pwd/\r\n\r\nSearch for all files and directories in current directory and below, which name contains letters 'p', 'w', 'd', with any other characters between them.\r\n\r\n    ff g/^(chk)?passwd/\r\n\r\nSearch for all files and directories in current directory and below, which name starts from 'chkpasswd' or 'passwd'.\r\n\r\nPlugins\r\n-------\r\n\r\nPlugins are the way to easily extend capabilities of `ff`. Currently there is only support for plugins allowing to extend tests made on files list. In future, there is plan to add support for plugins allowing to make some actions on found files (currently is _built-in plugin_: `--shell`), for example modifying, copying or anything else).\r\n\r\n`ff` search for plugins in two places (by default), but there is posibility to tell him about third one.\r\nAutomaticaly recognized paths are:\r\n* `~/.ff/plugins`\r\n* directory `ff_plugins` in programs root (if You have `ff` placed in `~/bin`, it will search for plugins in `~/bin/ff_plugins`)\r\n\r\nAnd using switch `--plugins-path` You can show `ff` where the plugins must be searched.\r\n\r\nYou can also pass argument to plugins. For example, in `size` plugin (You can download it from [GitHub](https://github.com/mysz/ff/tree/master/plugins)), You must to tell the plugin what size of file You expect:\r\n\r\n    `ff pas --test size:=5k`\r\n\r\nAbove example will find every file with _pas_ part in its name, and its size is *exactly* 5 [kibibytes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_prefix#IEC_standard_prefixes). More about `size` plugin in [projects wiki](https://github.com/mysz/ff/wiki/).\r\n\r\nWriting plugins\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nPlugins are written in [Python](http://python.org), and are simple Python modules with at least `plugin_action` callable specified. Plugins are imported, and `plugin_action` must return `True` or `False` to tell `ff` that given found object meets expectations, and should be returned.\r\n\r\n`ff` recognize and use only 3 objects in plugin:\r\n\r\n* `plugin_action` - (REQUIRED) [callable] must return `True` od `False`. Must recognize 3 arguments:\r\n    * `name` - name of plugin\r\n    * `argument` - argument passed by user\r\n    * `path` - absolute path to tested object\r\n* `PLUGIN_DESCR` - (OPTIONAL) [string or callable] short descr of plugin, printed when `ff` is called with switch `--help-test-plugins`\r\n* `PLUGIN_HELP` - (OPTIONAL) [string or callable] full help for plugin, printed when `ff` is called with switch `--help-test-plugins TEST_NAME`\r\n\r\nPlugin file also must have special name, and be placed in directory recognized by `ff` (see: [plugins][plugins]).\r\nName of file is built with three parts, connected with underscore:\r\n* `ffplugin` - fixed prefix\r\n* `test` - type of plugin (currently only `test` plugins are recignized)\r\n* `NAME` - name of plugin\r\n\r\nAnd as Python module, must and with `.py` extension :)\r\n\r\nPlugin must validate input data (`argument`), and raise `PluginError` exception with approbiate message on any error. Plugin shouldn't raise any other exceptions.\r\nThere is one caveat with this: `PluginError` exception is declared *inside* `ff`! When given plugin is imported, it is _monkeypatched_ and `PluginError` exception is injected into.\r\n\r\nThis is made by one of goals I have: try to have whole `ff` program in single file. It's important to me that I can move it easy between servers.\r\n\r\nThere is an example plugin, which allow us to search for files in specified size. Is in [project repository](https://github.com/mysz/ff/tree/master/plugins) in directory plugins. You can use it as a base for your own plugins :)\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\n`ff` should work on any platform where [Python](http://python.org) is available, it means Linux, Windows, MacOS X etc. There is no dependencies, plain Python power :) Just copy file to your PATH, for example:\r\n\r\n    curl https://raw.github.com/mysz/ff/master/ff.py > /usr/local/bin/ff\r\n\r\nor:\r\n\r\n    wget https://raw.github.com/mysz/ff/master/ff.py -O /usr/local/bin/ff\r\n\r\nVoila!\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\n    usage: ff.py [-h] [-0] [-i] [-s SOURCE] [-p PATTERN] [-g] [-f] [-q] [-l] [-d]\r\n                [-B] [-E] [-v] [-m {all,files,dirs}] [-x COMMAND] [--prefix]\r\n                [--no-display] [--verbose-exec] [--interactive-exec]\r\n                [--shell-exec] [--vcs] [-c EXCLUDED_PATH] [-t TESTS]\r\n                [--plugins-path PLUGINS_PATH] [--version]\r\n                [--help-test-plugins [TEST_NAME]]\r\n                [pattern] [sources [sources ...]]\r\n\r\n    Easily search and process files.\r\n\r\n    positional arguments:\r\n    pattern               pattern to search\r\n    sources               optional source (if missing, use current directory)\r\n\r\n    optional arguments:\r\n    -h, --help            show this help message and exit\r\n    -0, --print0          split results by binary zero instead of new line\r\n                          (useful to work with xargs)\r\n    -i, --ignorecase, --ignore-case\r\n    -s SOURCE, --source SOURCE\r\n                          optional, see: source above\r\n    -p PATTERN, --pattern PATTERN\r\n                          optional, see: pattern above\r\n    -g, --regexp          treat pattern as regular expression (uses Python\r\n                          regexp engine)\r\n    -f, --fuzzy           pattern defines only set and order of characters used\r\n                          in filename\r\n    -q, --path-search     search in full path, instead of bare name of item\r\n    -l, --regex-multiline\r\n    -d, --regex-dotall\r\n    -B, --begin           match pattern to begin of item name (ignored in regexp\r\n                          mode)\r\n    -E, --end             match pattern to end of item name (ignored in regexp\r\n                          mode)\r\n    -v, -r, --invert-match\r\n    -m {all,files,dirs}, --mode {all,files,dirs}\r\n    -x COMMAND, --exec COMMAND\r\n                          execute some command on every found item.

It allows to more \"nerdish\"\r\n    (or \"perlish\" :) ) way to control `ff` behavior.\r\n\r\n    The general pattern for magic pattern is:\r\n\r\n        mode/pattern/modifier\r\n\r\n    where:\r\n        `mode` - is one of 'p' (`--pattern`), 'g' - (`--regexp`) or 'f' (`--fuzzy`)\r\n        `/` - is delimiter:\r\n            * one of: '/', '!', '@', '#', '%', '|', and then start and end\r\n                delimiter must be the same\r\n            * one of: '{', '[', '(', '<', and the end delimiter must be the\r\n                closing one (ex. '}' if start is '{')\r\n        `pattern` - any pattern, processed in a way specified with `mode`\r\n        `modifier` - one of: 'i' (`--ignore-case`), 'm' (`--regex-multiline`),\r\n            's' (`--regex-dotall`), 'v' (not used currently), 'r' (`--invert-match`)\r\n            'q' (`--path-search`)\r\n\r\n    There is also ability to extend capabilities of `ff` by plugins. Plugins are\r\n    run with switch `--test` and then plugin name with optional plugin argument:\r\n\r\n        --test plugin_name:plugin_arg\r\n\r\n    There can be used more then one plugin at once.\r\n\r\n    Authors:\r\n        Marcin Sztolcman <marcin@urzenia.net> // http://urzenia.net\r\n\r\n    HomePage:\r\n        https://github.com/mysz/ff/\r\n\r\nContact\r\n-------\r\n\r\nIf you like or dislike this software, please do not hesitate to tell me about this me via email (marcin@urzenia.net).\r\n\r\nIf you find bug or have an idea to enhance this tool, please use GitHub's [issues](https://github.com/mysz/ff/issues).\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nThe MIT License (MIT)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2013 Marcin Sztolcman\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\r\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\r\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\r\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\r\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\r\nsubject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\r\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS\r\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
